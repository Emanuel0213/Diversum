## Diversum
Diversum is an inclusive social platform designed to foster meaningful connections among neurodivergent individuals. By offering a safe and accessible space for both friendships and romantic relationships, Diversum aims to break down barriers and create opportunities for everyone to thrive.

The platform is built on the Solana blockchain and utilizes SOL tokens for in-app transactions, rewards, and community engagement, ensuring both transparency and security.
